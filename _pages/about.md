Hi there! I recently got my bachelor degree in Computer Science at University of Washington in 2024. My research interest is around fairness in machine learning, interpretability, adaptation in online setting and efficient machine learning. My most recent work is on evaluating bias mitigation methods in the robustness and fairness space under incomplete and full demographic information. I'm actively applying to PhD program for Fall 2025.
